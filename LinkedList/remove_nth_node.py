# LeetCode 19 - Remove Nth node from end of the list
# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        slow = fast = dummy
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        while fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next # removing the ele
        return dummy.next
