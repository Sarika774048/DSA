# LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits

# Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.


class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            n &= (n - 1)
            res += 1
        return res
