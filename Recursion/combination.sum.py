# LeetCode 39 - Combination sum

# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
# The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

# Example 1:

# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []

        def backtrack(start, path, total):
            if total == target:
                result.append(path[:])
                return
            if total > target:
                return
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                path.append(candidates[i])
                backtrack(i, path, total + candidates[i])
                path.pop()
        backtrack(0, [], 0)
        return result
